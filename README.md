# IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Project (Python)

This repository contains my final assignment for the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**.  
The project demonstrates the complete workflow of data analysis using Python, from data collection to visualization and insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The project focuses on applying data analysis techniques to solve real-world business questions.  
Key steps include:
1. **Data Collection** – Importing and reading datasets using Python libraries.
2. **Data Wrangling** – Cleaning, preparing, and transforming raw data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying patterns, trends, and correlations.
4. **Data Visualization** – Creating charts and plots for clear communication of insights.
5. **Final Insights** – Answering business questions and presenting findings.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation & wrangling  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Requests / APIs** – For data collection (if applicable)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment
